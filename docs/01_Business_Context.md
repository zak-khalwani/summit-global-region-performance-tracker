# 1. Business Context: The Summit Global Inc. Case Study

This document provides a detailed background on the business drivers, strategic goals, and target audience for the Regional Performance Tracker.

## Problem Statement

The European sales division of Summit Global Inc. operates across dozens of countries and hundreds of cities. While the company had robust data collection, the Head of Sales faced a significant "last mile" analytics problem. Performance reports were often static, delivered weekly, and lacked crucial context. A country manager might see their total sales number but would struggle to quickly answer:

*   **Performance vs. Goal:** How far are we from our quarterly target right now, not last Tuesday?
*   **Historical Context:** Is a "miss" against our new, ambitious target still considered strong growth compared to last year?
*   **Diagnostic Detail:** If my country is underperforming, which specific cities or stores are the primary cause?

This delay and lack of interactivity meant that by the time a problem was properly diagnosed, a week or more had passed, representing lost opportunities for course correction.

## Project Goals & Objectives

The goal was to empower regional sales leaders with a real-time, interactive command center. The project had three primary objectives:

*   **Provide Immediate Context:** Every core metric (`Total Sales`) must be immediately compared against its two most important benchmarks: the `Target` and `Last Year` performance.
*   **Enable Top-Down Analysis:** Design the dashboard to allow a leader to view the entire European landscape, then seamlessly filter down to a specific country (via the map) and see the underlying city-level performance.
*   **Visualize Performance Trends:** Move beyond single-point-in-time numbers to rich, time-series visuals that show the *story* of performance over a quarter or a year.

## Target Audience

This dashboard is designed for sales leaders who own a P&L and are responsible for hitting a number:

*   **VP / Head of European Sales:** To monitor the overall health of the entire region and identify which countries need support or investment.
*   **Country and Regional Managers:** To track their specific territory's performance against their goal and diagnose issues at the city level.
